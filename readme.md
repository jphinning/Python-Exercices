## Numerical Methods in Python
 - List of Exercises I

Exercise: Complete the matrices.py script, using and expanding the mymatfunctions and mymatutils modules in order to complete the following matrix operations menu:

0) exit the program

1) matrix multiplication A (k, l) * B (m, n) using Python (without libraries) comparing with numpy multiplication: mR = mA @ mB or mR = mA.dot (mB)

2) multiply matrix by scalar

3) calculate and display Greatest, smallest and sum of matrix elements Make separate functions for matrix_min, matrix_max and matrix_sum Comparing with min(), max() and sum() (show or result of these)

4) matrix determinant (3x3) using Python (implement Sarrus Rule) show or result with numpy's det function (from numpy.linalg import det)

5) determinant of the 4x4 matrix using Python (using or Laplace's Theorem) Employ the function that calculates the det A (3 x 3) made for the previous item. Ditto, show the result with numpy

6) matrix transpose creating a function in Python that returns the transpose Being the matrix A = Aij (m x n) the transpose of A is At = A'ji (n x m). Show or transpose() result from numpy.

In all cases, calculate with discrete Python code and also calculate with respective numpy functions, showing both values.

When using numpy, create the np.array array from the python list using the functions in class (np.array, do not retype or reread the array) Ditto for the determinant (3x3)
